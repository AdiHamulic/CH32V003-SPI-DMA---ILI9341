### Introduction

Fast lcd driver for ILI9341 using WCH chip CH32V003 with SPI(at 24Mhz) - DMA.

This library was original made for STM32 micro by Tilen MAJERLE. I just added support and optimized for CH32V003.

Project is created for VSCode and makefile. In few places you need to modify path to RSIC-V GCC bin folder and modifed version of OpenOCD(from WCH).
